# Deployment Status - AgentSensorPlugin Fix

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PLUGIN NEEDS RELOAD

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps
1. ‚úÖ Code fixes applied (client-side ml_state_encoder.js)
2. ‚úÖ Code fixes committed to Git (commit 3c8a416)
3. ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub
4. ‚úÖ TeamCity build triggered (Build #20)
5. ‚úÖ Build completed successfully (AgentSensorPlugin-19.jar)
6. ‚úÖ JAR downloaded from TeamCity
7. ‚úÖ JAR copied to D:/MCServer/Server/plugins/

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue
**Minecraft server is still using the OLD plugin (build #17)**

**Evidence**:
```
[PLUGIN SENSOR] Nasmaraj receiving sensor data (274625 blocks, 26 entities)
```
Still sending 274k blocks instead of expected 3-5k!

### üîß Solution Required

**Option 1: Reload Plugin (Recommended)**
If server supports plugin reload:
```
/reload confirm
```
OR
```
/agentsensor update
```

**Option 2: Restart Minecraft Server**
1. Stop Minecraft server gracefully
2. The new JAR (AgentSensorPlugin-19.jar) will load
3. Old JAR (AgentSensorPlugin-17.jar) will be auto-deleted by plugin cleanup
4. Start server

**Option 3: Manual Plugin Swap (If server can't be restarted)**
1. Stop Node.js bots: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe`
2. In Minecraft console: `/stop`
3. Wait for server to shutdown
4. Delete old: `del "D:/MCServer/Server/plugins/AgentSensorPlugin-17.jar"`
5. Restart Minecraft server
6. Plugin will load fresh from AgentSensorPlugin-19.jar

### üìä Expected Results After Reload

**Before** (Current):
```
[PLUGIN SENSOR] <bot> receiving sensor data (274625 blocks, X entities)
[ML TRAINER] Error in agent step: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')
```

**After** (Expected):
```
[PLUGIN SENSOR] <bot> receiving sensor data (3847 blocks, X entities)
[ML ACTION] <bot> attempting action 42: mine_forward
[ML ACTION] <bot> action result: SUCCESS
[REWARD] <bot>: +0.50 (action: mine_forward) Total: 15.23
```

### üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Plugin sensor data shows 3,000-5,000 blocks (not 274k)
- [ ] No "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- [ ] Agents execute ML actions successfully
- [ ] Agents earn rewards for actions (not just survival)

### üìù Files Ready for Deployment

**Location**: D:/MCServer/Server/plugins/
- ‚úÖ AgentSensorPlugin-19.jar (NEW - 3.7MB)
- ‚ùå AgentSensorPlugin-17.jar (OLD - needs removal)

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Reload/Restart Minecraft server** to load new plugin
2. **Restart Node.js server**: `node server.js`
3. **Monitor console** for reduced block counts
4. **Verify ML actions** execute successfully
