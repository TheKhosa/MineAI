# Comprehensive ML Pre-Training System

## Overview

The **Comprehensive Pre-Training System** (`ml_pretrain_comprehensive.js`) is a production-grade, multi-stage pipeline that leverages **60+ million state-action pairs** from MineRL and optional OpenAI VPT foundation models to give your agents expert-level Minecraft skills before deployment.

This is **10x more extensive** than the basic pre-training system, with curriculum learning, multi-task training, data augmentation, and advanced neural network architecture.

## Architecture

### 4-Stage Training Pipeline

```
Stage 1: VPT Foundation (Optional)
    ↓ Load OpenAI's 70,000-hour pre-trained model

Stage 2: Multi-Task Learning (15 epochs)
    ↓ Train on ALL 5 MineRL datasets simultaneously

Stage 3: Curriculum Learning (45 epochs)
    ↓ Progressive difficulty: Easy → Hard tasks

Stage 4: Fine-Tuning (10 epochs)
    ↓ Focus on specific skills (crafting, combat, mining)

Result: SHARED_COLLECTIVE brain with expert skills
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Data Augmentation

**Rotation Augmentation**:
- Rotates movement actions (forward → left, left → back, etc.)
- Increases dataset size by 4x

**Noise Injection**:
- Adds 5% Gaussian noise to state vectors
- Improves robustness to sensor errors

**Temporal Jitter**:
- Randomly drops 10% of frames
- Teaches agents to handle missing data

### 2. Advanced Neural Network

**Architecture**:
```
Input (629 dims)
    ↓
Dense (512) + ReLU + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Residual Block 1 (256 → 256)
    ↓
Residual Block 2 (256 → 256)
    ↓
Dense (128) + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓
Output (216 dims) + Sigmoid
```

**Residual Connections**:
- Prevents vanishing gradients
- Enables deeper networks
- Better long-term learning

### 3. Curriculum Learning

**Progressive Difficulty**:
```
Weeks 1-2:  Treechop (★)           - Basic skills
Week 3:     Navigate (★★)          - Movement mastery
Week 4:     Navigate Dense (★★)    - Precision control
Weeks 5-6:  Obtain Iron (★★★)      - Crafting skills
Weeks 7-10: Obtain Diamond (★★★★)  - Expert gameplay
```

**Difficulty Balancing**:
- Easy tasks get more training weight (1.5x)
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- Gradual skill acquisition

### 4. Checkpoint Management

**Automatic Saving**:
- Saves **top-5 checkpoints** by validation loss
- Saves after each training stage
- Saves best epoch during multi-task learning

**Checkpoint Format**:
```
ml_models/checkpoints/
├── checkpoint_stage1_vpt.json
├── checkpoint_stage2_multitask_epoch_12.json  (best)
├── checkpoint_stage3_curriculum_difficulty_3.json
├── checkpoint_stage4_finetune_epoch_7.json  (best)
└── checkpoint_final_comprehensive.json
```

### 5. Multi-Task Learning

**Simultaneous Training**:
- Learns from ALL 5 datasets at once
- Balances batches (equal samples from each dataset)
- Learns generalizable skills (not task-specific)

**Training Metrics**:
```
[MULTITASK] Epoch 12/15
    Overall: loss=1.8234, acc=0.6721, val_loss=1.9012, val_acc=0.6543
    Treechop: acc=0.7821
    Navigate: acc=0.6234
    Iron: acc=0.5921
    Diamond: acc=0.5412
```

## Action Mapping (MineRL → 216 Actions)

### Movement Actions (0-15)
- MineRL: `forward`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `jump`, `sneak`, `sprint`
- Maps to: FORWARD, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, JUMP, SNEAK, SPRINT, combinations

### Combat Actions (16-30)
- MineRL: `attack`, `camera` (pitch/yaw)
- Maps to: ATTACK, CRITICAL_HIT, SHIELD_BLOCK, STRAFE_LEFT, STRAFE_RIGHT, COMBO_ATTACK

### Camera Actions (31-46)
- MineRL: `camera` (pitch, yaw deltas)
- Maps to: 16 discrete camera movements (up, down, left, right, diagonals)

### Inventory Actions (47-90)
- MineRL: `inventory` slot changes
- Maps to: TOSS_ITEM, SORT_INVENTORY, EQUIP_ARMOR_SET, SWAP_HOTBAR_OFFHAND, PRIORITIZE_VALUABLES

### Crafting Actions (91-110)
- MineRL: `craft` recipes (wooden_pickaxe, stone_axe, etc.)
- Maps to: 20 specific crafting actions (CRAFT_WOODEN_TOOLS, CRAFT_STONE_TOOLS, CRAFT_IRON_ARMOR, etc.)

### Advanced Actions (111-215)
- Container operations, enchanting, trading, agriculture, redstone, navigation
- Maps to: 105 advanced actions based on MineRL task context

**Mapping Strategy**:
- **Direct mapping**: Simple actions (forward → FORWARD)
- **Heuristic mapping**: Complex actions based on inventory/task context
- **Combination mapping**: Camera + movement → advanced navigation

## Configuration

### Edit Training Stages (ml_pretrain_comprehensive.js)

```javascript
this.trainingConfig = {
    foundation: {
        enabled: true,  // Use OpenAI VPT foundation model
        vptModelPath: './pretrain_data/vpt_foundation.model'
    },
    multiTask: {
        enabled: true,
        epochs: 15,      // Increase for better multi-task learning
        batchSize: 64,   // Reduce if out of memory
        learningRate: 0.0003
    },
    curriculum: {
        enabled: true,
        stagesEpochs: [5, 5, 10, 10, 15]  // Epochs per difficulty level
    },
    fineTune: {
        enabled: true,
        epochs: 10,
        focusSkills: ['crafting', 'combat', 'mining'],  // Skills to emphasize
        learningRate: 0.00005  // Lower rate for fine-tuning
    },
    augmentation: {
        enabled: true,
        rotateActions: true,   // 4x data via rotation
        addNoise: 0.05,        // 5% noise injection
        temporalJitter: true   // Random frame dropping
    }
};
```

### Skip Stages (For Testing)

```javascript
// Skip VPT foundation (faster startup)
foundation: { enabled: false }

// Skip curriculum learning (train on all difficulties at once)
curriculum: { enabled: false }

// Skip fine-tuning (deploy after multi-task)
fineTune: { enabled: false }
```

### Adjust Dataset Selection

```javascript
// Use only easy datasets (faster training, lower quality)
this.minerlDatasets = [
    { name: 'MineRLTreechop-v0', difficulty: 1, weight: 1.5 },
    { name: 'MineRLNavigate-v0', difficulty: 2, weight: 1.2 }
];

// Use only hard datasets (slower training, higher quality)
this.minerlDatasets = [
    { name: 'MineRLObtainIronPickaxe-v0', difficulty: 3, weight: 1.3 },
    { name: 'MineRLObtainDiamond-v0', difficulty: 4, weight: 1.5 }
];
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Out of memory during training"

**Solution 1**: Reduce batch size
```javascript
multiTask: { batchSize: 32 }  // Was 64
```

**Solution 2**: Train on fewer datasets
```javascript
// Use only 2-3 datasets instead of 5
this.minerlDatasets = [
    { name: 'MineRLTreechop-v0', difficulty: 1, weight: 1.5 },
    { name: 'MineRLObtainIronPickaxe-v0', difficulty: 3, weight: 1.3 }
];
```

**Solution 3**: Disable data augmentation
```javascript
augmentation: { enabled: false }
```

### Issue: "Training is too slow (> 48 hours)"

**Solution 1**: Use GPU acceleration
```bash
# Install TensorFlow GPU support
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu
```

**Solution 2**: Reduce epochs
```javascript
multiTask: { epochs: 10 },  // Was 15
curriculum: { stagesEpochs: [3, 3, 5, 5, 10] }  // Reduced
```

**Solution 3**: Skip curriculum learning
```javascript
curriculum: { enabled: false }
```

### Issue: "Low accuracy (< 40%) after training"

**Diagnosis**: This is **normal** for behavioral cloning on complex tasks like Minecraft.

**Expected Accuracies**:
- Treechop: 70-80% (simple actions)
- Navigate: 60-70% (more variability)
- Iron/Diamond: 50-60% (complex multi-step tasks)

**Solutions**:
1. **More epochs**: Increase to 20-30 per stage
2. **Focus on easy tasks**: Train longer on Treechop/Navigate
3. **Fine-tuning with RL**: Let agents improve via live gameplay after pre-training

### Issue: "Agents still perform poorly after pre-training"

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Did you copy the comprehensive pre-trained model?
   ```bash
   cp ml_models/brain_SHARED_COLLECTIVE_comprehensive.json ml_models/brain_SHARED_COLLECTIVE.json
   ```

2. ✅ Did you restart the server?
   ```bash
   node server.js  # Fresh start loads new weights
   ```

3. ✅ Check if model was loaded:
   ```
   [ML TRAINER] Loading SHARED_COLLECTIVE brain from ml_models/brain_SHARED_COLLECTIVE.json
   [ML TRAINER] Metadata: {pretrained: true, pretrainDataset: 'MineRL-Comprehensive'}
   ```

4. ✅ Verify training completed successfully:
   ```
   [PRETRAIN] ✓ Stage 4/4 Complete: Fine-Tuning
   [PRETRAIN] Final validation accuracy: 0.6234
   ```

## OpenAI VPT Integration (Optional)

### Download VPT Foundation Model

```bash
# Clone VPT repository
git clone https://github.com/openai/Video-Pre-Training.git pretrain_data/vpt

# Download foundation model (~500MB)
cd pretrain_data/vpt
wget https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/minecraft-rl/models/foundation-model-1x.model

# Move to expected location
mv foundation-model-1x.model ../vpt_foundation.model
```

### Convert VPT Weights (Advanced)

VPT uses PyTorch, our system uses TensorFlow.js. Conversion required:

```python
# pretrain_data/convert_vpt.py
import torch
import json

# Load VPT model
vpt_model = torch.load('vpt_foundation.model')

# Extract policy network weights
policy_weights = vpt_model['policy']

# Convert to TensorFlow.js format
# (Implementation requires manual layer mapping)
```

**Note**: VPT conversion is complex and optional. Multi-task MineRL training alone provides excellent results.

---

## Next Steps After Pre-Training

### 1. Deploy and Monitor

```bash
# Deploy pre-trained model
cp ml_models/brain_SHARED_COLLECTIVE_comprehensive.json ml_models/brain_SHARED_COLLECTIVE.json

# Start server with monitoring
node server.js | tee logs/pretrained_agents.log

# Watch rewards in real-time
tail -f logs/agent_rewards.log
```

**Expected first 10 episodes**:
```
Episode 1: Reward +38.2 (agent chops tree, crafts pickaxe!)
Episode 2: Reward +45.7 (mines stone, crafts furnace)
Episode 3: Reward +52.3 (explores cave, finds iron)
...
```

### 2. Server-Specific Fine-Tuning

Pre-trained agents have **general Minecraft skills** but will adapt to YOUR specific server:
- Custom terrain generation
- Modded items/blocks
- Server-specific goals
- Unique spawn conditions

**Let RL training continue** for 500-1000 episodes to specialize.

### 3. Advanced: Multi-Agent Pre-Training

Train different models for different roles:

```bash
# Pre-train miner specialist
node ml_pretrain_comprehensive.js --focus mining --output brain_MINER

# Pre-train builder specialist
node ml_pretrain_comprehensive.js --focus crafting --output brain_BUILDER

# Pre-train combat specialist
node ml_pretrain_comprehensive.js --focus combat --output brain_WARRIOR
```

Assign different brains to different agent roles in `config.js`.

### 4. Continuous Learning

**Best practice**:
1. Pre-train for 8-12 hours (comprehensive)
2. Deploy to live server
3. Let RL training continue (improves beyond pre-training)
4. Save checkpoints every 1000 episodes
5. Compare performance vs pre-trained baseline

---
